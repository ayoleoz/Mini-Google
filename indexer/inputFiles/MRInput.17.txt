michael kassan that was moderated by variety coeditorinchief cynthia littleton mayer answered a number of key questions about how candle media intends to function  for one its not a holding company nor an operating entity  and he detailed the vision for social commerce activity tied to such media stars such as reese witherspoon will smith and jada pinkett smith we do have a vision for a modern

delivered on an ondemand basis through streaming services theres no fundamental reason to have a linear channel experience for entertainment as a matter of fact people dont prefer it kassan said the current work shortage that has been reported on has caused an increase demand across the industry kassan also said in todays media landscape having people in the industry who understand the data behind the content is more vital for companies than ever there was a period in the marketing advertising media business that mad men were the people you were looking for kassan said and today its math
