controversial bill restricting how race is taught in public schools because they missed a midnight deadline in the final moments of the  session a state senate spokesperson confirmed early sunday lawmakers had spent weeks during the legislative session debating and advancing proposed bills similar to the antiracism act of  it wasnt immediately clear why republicans waited until late saturday to take the final vote the act had passed the senate and house overwhelmingly and the latenight vote was merely to greenlight the houses version we took the vote but essentially that didnt matter because it didnt make deadline senate spokesperson jacque bland told the associated press in an email early sunday she said the education bill has no path forward to becoming law a separate bill restricting abortion access did pass just minutes before midnight it bars parents from seeking abortion care because they believe their child will be born with a disability it provides exemptions in the case of a medical emergency or in cases where a fetus is nonmedically viable gop lawmakers appeared unhurried as the clock ticked down saturday spending about an hour passing resolutions honoring two outgoing senators supporters of the antiracism act of  said it aims to prevent discrimination based on race in k public schools banning teachers from telling students that one race is inherently racist or oppressive whether consciously or unconsciously the bill said students cant be taught a persons moral character is determined by their race or that a person by virtue of their race bears responsibility for actions committed by other members of the same race it would have created a mechanism for reporting complaints and for the legislature to collect data on how many complaints are substantiated each year the law didnt specify punishment legislators convened at the snowy state capitol on saturday with dozens of bills to finalize gop house speaker roger hanshaw arrived late to a debate on the state budget bill because he was delayed by a car accident on the roads which were still being cleared the bill dealing with disabilities and abortion was passed just minutes before midnight the final passage of the bill happened hours after the house passed the bill following  minutes of debate this is about science and morality said republican del kayla kessinger in support of the bill its about when does life begin and whether or not it has a value democrats voiced their opposition with del evan hansen saying the bill does nothing substantial to help people with disabilities and their families this is an attempt to use people with disabilities as props for an antiabortion agenda something that the disability community has not asked for as far as i know  and thats just wrong hansen said it creates government overreach into personal family medical decisions a physician who violates the law could see their license to practice medicine suspended or revoked the bill also requires physicians to submit a report  with patients names omitted  to the state for each abortion they perform and whether the presence or presumed presence of any disability in the unborn human being had been detected the reports would include the date of the abortion and the method used as well as confirming the doctor asked the patient if they chose an abortion because the baby might have a disability these reports must be submitted within  days of each abortion the bill now moves to the desk of republican gov jim justice that bill wasnt the only abortionrelated

with an additional bump for state troopers the budget does not include the  personal income tax cut passed by the house last month the house and senate could not come to an agreement on how to incorporate the cuts into the bill lawmakers also promised that social workers in the states foster care system will see a  pay raise after a bill to provide the increases was essentially gutted they
